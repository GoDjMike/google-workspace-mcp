refactor: split google_api_request into dedicated auth tools

BREAKING CHANGE: The google_api_request tool has been removed and replaced with two new tools:

1. list_google_accounts: New tool that lists all configured Google accounts and their authentication status
   - Shows which accounts are available
   - Displays current authentication status
   - Lists authorized scopes and token expiration

2. authenticate_google_account: Dedicated tool for handling Google account authentication
   - Clearer purpose focused on authentication flow
   - Handles both initial setup and token refresh
   - Improved error messages and user guidance

Changes:
- Added auth_status to Account interface
- Updated TokenManager with getTokenStatus method
- Split GoogleApiRequestParams into GoogleAuthParams
- Updated documentation with new tools and examples
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added account validation before authentication

This change improves the authentication workflow by:
- Making it explicit which accounts are available
- Providing clear authentication status
- Separating concerns between auth and API access
- Improving error handling and user guidance
