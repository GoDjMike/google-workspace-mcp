# Active Context

## Current Task
Investigating potential code duplication in the codebase.

## Recent Analysis
1. Completed code analysis of:
   - Gmail and Calendar service implementations
   - Account management system
   - Token handling mechanisms
   - Error handling patterns

2. Identified Duplication Areas:
   - Service Module Authentication: Both services implement similar client initialization
   - Error Handling: Redundant error classes and handling patterns
   - Token Management: Scattered token validation and refresh logic
   - API Response Processing: Similar transformation patterns
   - Configuration: Duplicate environment handling
   - Tool Registration: Repeated registration patterns

3. Proposed Solutions:
   - Create BaseGoogleService for common service patterns
   - Implement unified error handling system
   - Centralize token management
   - Create shared API utilities
   - Develop unified configuration system
   - Build tool registration utility

## Next Steps
1. Implementation Priority:
   - Start with BaseGoogleService class
   - Gradually refactor error handling
   - Consolidate token management
   - Create shared utilities
   - Update configuration system
   - Streamline tool registration

2. Expected Benefits:
   - 30-40% reduction in code duplication
   - Improved maintainability
   - Easier service additions
   - Consistent error handling
   - Simplified auth flows
